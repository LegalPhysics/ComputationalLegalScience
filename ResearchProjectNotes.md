How can system dynamics and agent based modeling be combined to evaluate legal systems? 

# Brainstorming:

We can choose a formal partial model of the legal system (marginalizing the factors that are unimpotant for puroses of the iquiry).  

**Two Comparisons:**
* Time (changes in the law over time)
* Space (differences in the law across states)

# Potential Computational Research Study Candidates

## Model of Social Topologies and Communications-Based Network Map of Legal Systems 

* Using email logs for mail traffic between agencies in gov't

* create visualizations showing flows to reveal correlations such as:

- perhaps when elections are coming, flows look like this
- or when a major political event is happening, flows look like that.

* COMPARE between different states

**Research Methods**

We can send pub records request to (ITD?) for email records over time?

Get statutory auth of each agency and get the "political appointees" on org 


## Bankruptcy Model 

### Criminal Law:

Can crime stats be predicted based upon the legal system and demographic patterns?
 - This can be tested by looking at legal system parameters such as a) what IS a crime and b) convition stats, c) sententing, and the 

Legal System Properties: (may be direct structural properties or actual parameters that you can eg change up and down)
 * Statutory Data: 
   - what is a crime, what drugs are illegal, what conduct is illegal, etc)
 * Judicial Data: convictions, sentencing, aquitals.  
 
 Legal System Inputs and Outputs:
 * Demographic / census data (captures some economic data/sociological/age, etc)
 * Crime Rates and Drug Use (Blight on Society (crack houses, homeless, secondary crimes, etc) 

# Next Actions:

## Lit Review

## Collecting relevant data sets

* Statutory likely to be more structural... 
* Judicial data - likely to be more parametric 
* Sentencing data and BJS data another source to be examned.  

## Next meeting with Ankur: review the data sets and context we learned and **develop the model together.**
